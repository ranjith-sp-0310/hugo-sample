Once upon a time, there were two women, Pradeepa and Poornima, who were both single and looking for love. They both had a lot in common and found themselves becoming close friends.

One day, after spending a lot of time together, Pradeepa and Poornima realized that their friendship had turned into something much more. They were in love.

At first, they were hesitant to tell anyone about their relationship, but eventually, Pradeepa and Poornima decided to be open about it.

Unfortunately, the couple faced a lot of opposition from their families and friends. There were people who thought it was wrong for two women to be in love, and they were judged and ridiculed for their relationship.

Still, Pradeepa and Poornima were determined to stay together and face whatever challenges came their way. They had faith that, with each other's support, they would be able to overcome all the difficulties.

So, Pradeepa and Poornima decided to start a life together and get married. Although it was a difficult decision, they were determined to make it work.

Pradeepa and Poornima faced many obstacles in their relationship. They had to fight against societyâ€™s negative attitudes towards their relationship, and sometimes they even had to fight for their right to love each other. But despite all the hardships, the couple always found a way to stay strong and be together.

Finally, after many years of being together, Pradeepa and Poornima were able to prove to everyone that love can still conquer all. They were now a happily married couple, and their love was celebrated by all.

The moral of the story is that love is the most powerful force in the world, and no matter how hard the journey may be, if two people truly love each other, they will always find a way to be together.
